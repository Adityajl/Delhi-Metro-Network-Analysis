# 🚇 **Delhi Metro Network Analysis**

This project analyzes the **Delhi Metro network** to improve urban transportation, optimize routes, and enhance commuter experiences. Using data analysis and visualization, we provide insights into the metro’s efficiency, congestion, and travel patterns.

---

## 🎯 **Project Goals**
1. **Optimize Routes**: Reduce travel times and balance passenger loads.
2. **Improve Passenger Flow**: Analyze peak hour traffic and station congestion.
3. **Understand Travel Patterns**: Derive insights from daily commuter data.
4. **Support Future Planning**: Provide data-driven insights for network expansion.

## 🛠️ **Process Overview**
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data on metro lines, stations, schedules, and passenger flow.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Addressed inconsistencies and missing values.
3. **Visualization**:
   - **Route Maps**: Created interactive visualizations using **Folium**.
   - **Congestion Heat Maps**: Highlighted crowded and underused stations.

---

## 🔍 **Key Insights**
- **Congested Stations**: High-traffic hubs like *Rajiv Chowk* and *Hauz Khas*.
- **Underused Stations**: Newer lines exhibit lower ridership.
- **Bottlenecks**: Inefficient transfer points cause delays.

---

## 📈 **Future Directions**
- **Dynamic Route Optimization**: Use AI to manage congestion in real time.
- **Smart Scheduling**: Adjust train frequencies based on peak demand.
- **Expansion Insights**: Recommend locations for future stations or lines.
